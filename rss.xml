            <title><![CDATA[Undertakers]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Undertakers</h1><h2>Gameplay and user interface design</h2><p>Undertakers is a networked four-player competitive shooter developed during Columbia College Chicago's Large Team 2013 senior capstone project. The year-long (two-semester) sequence was structured as a commercial development project, complete with all production phases (pre-production/concept, production, QA, and release). The object of this free-for-all game is to scour the Wild West town of Abandon to find a bar of gold and hide it from your opponents. The longer the gold stays hidden, the more points you get.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cb0447f8fceae2b1c8edb76c9b4203eb3de44dcf.png"></article>]]></description>
