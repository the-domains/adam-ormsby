Because of my experience using the Mecanim animation tool provided with the Unity 3D game engine, I was invited to speak at the Tech Art Bootcamp held during the 2014 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. I co-presented a postmortem on our use of Mecanim for implementing character animation on the Undertakers project developed in my final year of school.

## Gave a postmortem on Mecanim

The talk was titled Postmortem: Mecanim in Undertakers, and we focused mostly on the changes our pipeline had to go through as we implemented Mecanim mid-project. We discussed topics such as optimizing our animation pipeline, making changes to our movement code, and building animation trees in the visual editor as well as the pros and cons of every decision made throughout this process. I would love to speak about my other experiences if the opportunity arises.
