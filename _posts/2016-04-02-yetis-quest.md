# Yeti's Quest

Yeti's Quest is a memory-based runner developed for iOS devices. Rich in Buddhist mythology, Yeti's Quest is about a yeti named Dorze who has come back home to Nepal after a journey around the world. But when he attempts to travel up the mountainside the demon Mara blocks his way with enchanted gates. Dorze must run up the mountain, crashing through the magical gates and facing many challenges as he attempts to make it back home.

## Developed gameplay and user interface systems

As the primary programmer on the project I developed every gameplay system from start to finish. This includes basic player movement, environmental interaction, UI interactions/events, and general player progression. I also developed my own simple save/load system to properly preserve player progress over time.

## Designed level layouts collaboratively

I worked closely with our environment artist to design the layouts for each of the 8 levels present in Yeti's Quest. We began by sketching our level paths from a top-down perspective which I then took and applied to a grid that helped me determine the distance and timing of key points along the path. Using those layouts I could build the levels directly in the editor by following the grid system I had created.

## Built and integrated development tools

We used the Unity 3D game engine for this project, but our toolset was initially lacking when it came to level building. To save time, we purchased a number of tool packages from the Unity Asset Store to create the core of our level pipeline, but since these did not initially work together I spent some time connecting them with custom code. I also built our procedural generation system for path obstacles from scratch.
