# The MecWarriors - Freelance Work
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed369228-ee65-422b-a82b-5cb2215a180f.png)

During my time under the MecWarriors name, I took on various freelance projects with clients across the world. While most projects were not notable enough to include here, two projects stand out as an example of some of my finest work during this period.

## Imparta Ltd. -- Upgraded to Mecanim

After the release of Unity 3D's Mecanim animation system, many developers were interested in leaving the Legacy system behind and upgrading their pipelines to work with the new toolset. Over the course of a few months, I worked with the UK company Imparta Ltd. to help develop a new pipeline and animation management system for their simulation project. Included in this work was the development of a basic pathfinding system for character self-navigation.

## Fair Games Productions -- First person controller

At one point I was contacted by a representative of Fair Games Productions with a work request for a first person character controller for use in an online shooter. The prototype I provided for them was a fully animation-driven character along with basic camera setup whose motion values were fully exposed in the game editor for further design tweaks. I also developed a simple snap-to-cover system for them to ensure the character controller supported the kinds of motions they sought long-term.
