# The MecWarriors
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2d421b8b-bf58-422c-a402-544bb33806ff.png)

I started The MecWarriors as a way to share my Mecanim knowledge with other users of the Unity 3D game engine. After its initial release the toolset was rather tricky to use, and I wanted to smooth out the learning curve for users that were new to visual animation networks. I launched the blog and managed the posts of different team members at varying times throughout its lifecycle.

## Wrote Mecanim tutorials

I got pretty great at writing technical tutorials over time, and I even began a foray into video tutorials after a while which really gave me a nice grounding in basic video editing skills that I hope to use in future projects. The goal of each tutorial was to explain each step in a simple process as thoroughly as possible so that readers could not only learn the steps they needed to get things moving, but also so they understood why each step was taken
