# Unannounced Project

## Technical Animator at Deep Silver Volition

## Developed character animation networks

My primary focus on this project was the development and maintenance of complex animation networks that drive in-game character motion. I helped our animators integrate their assets alongside various game systems and create the motions and character sequences seen during gameplay, all of which were edited using an in-house animation node graph system. I also worked regularly with the animation programmers to assist with implementation and testing of new features in our editor.

## Streamlined pipelines and processes

During my time working with the animation node graph system, I performed regular reviews of the pipelines and processes for implementation of new character behaviors. By communicating my findings with the animation and programming teams we were able to make improvements to our animation implementation workflow throughout the project.
