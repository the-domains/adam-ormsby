# Intern - Backflip Studios

In the summer between my final years of school I was hired by Backflip Studios as a game design intern. During this time I work with other designers to update some of their more popular iOS games as well as develop a new one. For each project I performed very different functions as a designer.

Ragdoll Blaster 3: Deluxe HD

In an effort to improve Ragdoll Blaster 3, a re-release of the game was planned with updated levels designed to provide a better player experience. I worked with the design team to modify existing levels and created a few new ones of my own during this process. These are my levels that made it into the re-release: Rubbish Pile (new level), Speedy Spelunking (re-design), and Candy-a-pult (re-design).

Paper Toss Friends

I assisted other designers with the creation of a matchmaking and ranking system for Paper Toss Friends before its release. The system was designed to match players based on a tracked skill level but also to be invisible to players to reinforce an atmosphere of casual play. I also wrote some of the text displayed when various in-game events occur.

Graffiti Ball

My job on the Graffiti Ball project was to adjust level layouts to better fit the resolution of both iPhone and iPad devices, thus removing ways for player to effectively skip levels due to the difference in device size. Altering the level source files as minimally as possible, I was able to get great fits on both size devices and the game was updated with my changes.
