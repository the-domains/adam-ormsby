Luminus is a game about capturing fireflies using only your facial expressions. Using Faceshift's facial recognition software to drive real-time facial capture, Luminus can determine if the player is smiling at one group of fireflies, making a kissy face at another, and even sneering angrily to remove the pesky thorn bushes that would mean the end of the player's fun. A unique game experience, Luminus brings our most basic emotions into play and turns them into a way to communicate with fireflies in a way we normally can't. This short project was developed in only 2 weeks.

## Developed all gameplay systems

I designed and programmed all game systems including firefly capture, thorn destruction, and character movement in the game world. All of these systems had to support the overall whimsical feel of the gameplay, and so I made sure that everything felt leisurely and somewhat 'floaty' while still making sure that any player input (facial expression) was easily understood and would generate a quick response from the game.

## Designed user interface for facial interaction

When designing the user interface for Luminus my primary goal was to create a menu system that was simple enough to use facial expression as the primary input. If the player had to use the mouse to do anything other than exit the game, we would be unsuccessful in this. The menu remained very simple and only displayed buttons to play again, to quit, or to see the credits, and all of these buttons could be 'pressed' by performing simple, yet discreet, facial expressions in front of the camera.

## Integrated Faceshift recognition software

I worked directly with representatives from Faceshift to integrate their new plugin into our Unity 3D game project so that we could track player facial expression in real time and allow them to interact with the game hands-free. This project was used by Faceshift as a tech demo at the NeuroGaming Conference in 2014\.
